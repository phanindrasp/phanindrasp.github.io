     <h3 style="color:white;"> Carnatic music</h3>
     <p style="color:white;">I'm an avid listener of raga music, especially carnatic (South Indian). Whenever I get time, you'll find me musing over old recordings of maestros such as M D Ramanathan and M Balamuralikrishna. Apart from Indian music, I also enjoy listening to promiment western composers like Chopin, Vivaldi and Mozart. </p>

     <p style="color:white;">I love to explore the grandeur of the nighsky. I keep searching for places around me with low light pollution. Above are the pictures of saturn and jupiter from my 3 inch scope taken from my phone :)  </p>

    <h3 style="color:white;"> Philosophy</h3>
     <p style="color:white;">I'm also passionate about theology and the history of religion. I'm really curious about the greek philosphers from the pre-socratic era, whose philosophies share a lot of common elements with the Indian vedic and upanishadic thought. I also love reading books. Currently reading Fernando Pessoa's masterpiece "Book of Disquiet".</p>
